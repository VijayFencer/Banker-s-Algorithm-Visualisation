# Banker's Algorithm Visualisation

## Overview
This repository contains a visualisation tool for the Banker's Algorithm. The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an "s-state" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualisation**: This tool provides an interactive visualisation of the Banker's Algorithm, making it easier to understand the process and logic behind it.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: The algorithm is executed step-by-step, allowing users to follow along and understand each operation.
- **Resource Allocation Graph**: A resource allocation graph is displayed, showing the current state of resource allocation and requests.

## How to Use
1. Visit the [repository](https://github.com/VijayFencer/Banker-s-Algorithm-Visualisation) on GitHub.
2. No installation is required as the project is already deployed.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the repository to use the visualisation tool.

## Requirements
This project doesn't require any specific software or libraries to run as it is already deployed and can be accessed directly from the repository.
